## How to install it ?

* Go to the releases
* Download SatellaZone (If you don't have an android phone or something to make an unsecured hotspot, download LocalSatellaZone.)
* Extract and simply drag & drop the romfs folder in SD:/luma/titles/TITLE-ID/
* You also need to "enable game patching" in the luma configuration menu (Hold select before you boot up your console)

## How to watch videos?
* A tutorial can be found on the main page of SatellaZone by clicking the (?) button, here is the tutorial:
* Step 1: Make a hotspot named "NintendoSpotPass1" (wihout "") with no security using a android phone.
* Step 2: Launch Nintendo Zone. if you can't, download usapatch.zip and copy the contents to SD:/luma/titles/0004003000008F02/. If there isn't the title id, make the folder in the titles folder. If you get an error when you connect to it, ignore it.
* Step 3: Enjoy!

## What is LocalSatellaZone?
It is SatellaZone, but you don't have to make an unsecured hotspot to watch the videos.
