## This project is a 3DS Nintendo Zone Revival.  
* Trailer : https://youtu.be/7QpJw4a_EqE  
* Discord : https://discord.gg/csSWztn6z4  

## How to install it ?

* Go to https://github.com/MegaPika/SatellaZone/releases
* Download the SatellaZone archive,
* Extract the .zip and simply drag & drop the romfs folder in SD:/luma/titles/TITLE-ID/
* You also need to "enable game patching" in the luma configuration menu (Press select + boot when console off).

## How do watch videos? (on normal SatellaZone, not Local one)
* A tutorial can be found on the main page of SatellaZone by clicking the (?) button, here is the tutorial:
* Make a hotspot named "NintendoSpotPass1" (wihout "") using a phone or something else wihout password,
* Launch Nintendo zone, if it take a long time to try to load something (so official servers but it's down) then the hotspot worked,
* Ignore the error and you can now watch videos!

## What is "LocalSatellaZone" archive?
This archive means the videos are stored on SDcard, so you don't need to use a hotspot but it take many space on sdcard.

## How to get the TITLE-ID ?

Here is the titleIDs:
