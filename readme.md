    EUR : `0004001000022B00`
    
    USA : `0004001000021B00`
    
    JPN : `0004001000020B00`
     
* For USA consoles, you may also need the `UsaPatch.zip` file; see below for instructions.

## How to watch videos?
* First, follow the install tutorial above.
1. Go to https://github.com/InternalLoss/3DS-SSL-Patch
*Download the `code.ips` from the listed files, and move it to `SD:/luma/titles/0004013000002F02/`
* If there is no `0004013000002F02` folder, create it. 
2. Make an unsecured/passwordless hotspot named `NintendoSpotPass1`. Most Androids support this.
3. Launch Nintendo Zone. if you can't, download UsaPatch.zip and copy the contents to `SD:/luma/titles/0004003000008F02/` If the `0004003000008F02` folder doesn't exist, create it! 
4. Enjoy!
* An error upon connecting is normal.

## What is LocalSatellaZone and why is it there?
Instead of using the internet, the data is stored on the SD Card. If you can't make an unsecured hotspot, use this!

## What is UsaPatch?

UsaPatch lets you bypass the lock on the Nintendo Zone Viewer for specifically **USA consoles**. This lock is not present on other console regions. Just download the file and copy the contents to the root of your SD Card.
