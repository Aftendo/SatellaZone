SatellaZone is a 3DS Nintendo Zone Revival patch that allows you to access archives from different stores and restaurants such as Best Buy, AT&T, McDonalds...
You can also access videos using the "LocalSatellaZone" version.
You can be able to access Nintendo Zone without having to launch FBI by downloading the UsaPatch (which is for USA consoles only).

## How to watch videos? / What is LocalSatellaZone and why is it there?
LocalSatellaZone is like SatellaZone, but instead the videos are stored into the SD Card.

## What is UsaPatch?

UsaPatch is a patch to let you launch Nintendo Zone from the homemenu and is for **USA consoles only!** Just download the folder and copy the contents to the root of your SD Card.

## How to launch Nzone (EUR)? / How to make Nzone (EUR) to appear on the homemenu?

You can launch Nintendo Zone by going in FBI -> titles -> and in the red (nand) titles search for Nintendo Zone -> Press the `A` button and click on `Launch Title`.

New method for unlocking (EUR) ! (Thanks MettleSphee)
To make Nintendo Zone (EUR) appear on the homemenu,
1. Create an hotspot called `NintendoSpotPass1` without a password. 
*Apparently you can use an hotspot with a password and it also works but it didn't worked for me.*
2. Add the hotspot to your internet connections and remember the number of the connection.
3. Go back to the homemenu, now open the `Rosalina menu` by pressing `L+Down+Select` at the same time.
4. Go in `System configuration`, `Control Wireless connection`, and select the number of the hotspot.
5. After that just wait a bit and it should appear on the menu!
(Now that you did that you can remove the hotspot from the settings and everything)
