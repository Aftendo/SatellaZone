## How to launch Nzone (EUR)? / How to make Nzone (EUR) to appear on the homemenu ?

You can launch Nintendo Zone by going in FBI -> titles -> and in the red (nand) titles search for Nintendo Zone -> Press the `A` button and click on `Launch Title`.

To make Nintendo Zone (EUR) appear on the homemenu, you need to create an hotspot called `NintendoSpotPass1` without a password and remove all your internet connetions. After that just wait a little bit on the homemenu and it should appear !
