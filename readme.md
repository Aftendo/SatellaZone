* Trailer : https://youtu.be/3sz7-zEtvOg 
* Discord : https://discord.gg/csSWztn6z4  

## How to install SatellaZone?

* Go to the releases
* Download SatellaZone (if you see LocalSatellaZone, see "What is LocalSatellaZone and why is it there" by scrolling down.)
* Extract and simply drag & drop the romfs folder in SD:/luma/titles/TITLE-ID/
* You also need to "enable game patching" in the luma configuration menu (Hold select before you boot up your console)

## How to watch videos?
* Download the "LocalSatellaZone" version because there are no videos on the normal one.

~~A tutorial can be found on the main page of SatellaZone by clicking the (?) button, here is the tutorial:~~
~~Step 1: Go to here, Download code.ips in the source code, and move it to SD:/luma/titles/0004013000002F02/. If there is no folder for it, make it. https://github.com/InternalLoss/3DS-SSL-Patch~~
~~Step 2: Make a hotspot named "NintendoSpotPass1" (wihout "") with no security using an android phone for example.~~
~~Step 3: Launch Nintendo Zone. if you can't, download usapatch.zip and copy the contents to SD:/luma/titles/0004003000008F02/. If there isn't the title id, make the folder in the titles folder. If you get an error when you connect to it, ignore it.~~
~~Step 4: Enjoy!~~

## What is LocalSatellaZone and why is it there?
LocalSatellaZone is like SatellaZone, but instead the videos are stored into the SD Card, and it is because nowadays, people with different phones, laptops, etc can only have a secure hotspot for others to connect. For example: iPhone and Windows can only have a secure hotspot, so Android is the only one to make an unsecured hotspot currently.

## What are the Title ID's for Nintendo Zone?

    EUR : 0004001000022B00
    USA : 0004001000021B00

## What is UsaPatch?

UsaPatch is a patch to let you launch Nintendo Zone from the homemenu and is for **USA consoles only!** Just download the folder and copy the contents to the root of your SD Card.
